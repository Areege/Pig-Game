# Pig Game (Created October 2016)

In this program, the user is repeatedly asked whether or not they would like to roll the dice. If they enter 'y' for yes, the program generates two randomized numbers. If either of the numbers are '1', the player's score is reverted back to zero and their turn is ended. Otherwise, the program adds the two numbers to the player's total score. If the player 'rolls' two identical numbers, they get to 'roll' again. Once their turn is ended (either by 'rolling' a 1 or choosing 'n' for no), the computer plays its turn. The winner is determined when either the player or the computer reaches a total score of 100.
